![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e94ea60d-cae9-4a3e-9390-585af6773f40)

A web application that allows users to search for articles on Wikipedia and view the search results.

⭐Features

- Search bar to input search queries
- Displays search results with title, link, and description
- Uses Wikipedia API to fetch search results
- Loading spinner to indicate search results are being fetched

⭐Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (Fetch API)

⭐How it Works

1. User inputs a search query in the search bar and presses Enter.
2. The application sends a GET request to the Wikipedia API with the search query.
3. The API returns the search results in JSON format.
4. The application parses the JSON data and displays the search results on the page.

⭐Code Structure

The code is structured into several files:

- `wikipedia.html`: The main HTML file that contains the search bar and search results container.
- `wikipedia.css`: The CSS file that styles the application.
- `wikipedia.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching search results and displaying them on the page.
